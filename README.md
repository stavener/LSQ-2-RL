# LSQ-2-RL
Supervised learning as reinforcement learning

My first example of a RL problem and codespaces now that I have a github educational license.


I want to do an example of supervised learning as reinforcement learning. I want to use a gymnasium that mirrors a supervised learning problem. I want to use a simple linear regression problem as the gymnasium environment. The agent will be a simple linear regression model that learns to predict the output of the environment. I want the observations to be a single variable x and the action to be the predicted output y. The reward will be the negative mean squared error between the predicted output and the true output. Set up all additional files for installing the libraries in a virtual environment and running the code.
